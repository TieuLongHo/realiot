Inside, there's an intriguing project underway—a setup of colorful LEDs. These LEDs are not just any lights, they can transform your space into a vibrant display of colors, all at your fingertips. One day, disaster strikes! The physical switch used to control these magical LEDs suddenly stops working. No matter how many times you press it, the lights remain unchanged. Frustrated but determined, you realize there's a solution—harnessing the power of technology to control the LEDs from afar. Your task is to create a simple LED controller that can turn the lights on and off with the press of a button.
